### Hey there <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px">

English is my second language, Ruby is my first. 

I got my first coding job as a junior software engineer! My first day is 6/28/21 and I want to take a break from exploring different languages and focus on Ruby since that is what the company uses.  

- ðŸ“ƒ I'm currently doing a 100 days of code challenge. (7/22/21 will be my last commit)
